# boop Framework — TODO

Active work items. Completed items live in DEVLOG.md.
Inline TODOs in source files should reference entries here by section name.

---

## ★ Namespace, ClassPath, Index, and Configuration System

**Priority item.** ✓ Core implementation complete. The framework now has:
- `__boop.classResolve` — namespace-aware resolution (classPath → index → dynamic discovery)
- `__boop.loader` — RC chain sourcing, BOOPPATH parsing, .boopIndex sourcing, version mismatch detection
- `__boop.import` — rewritten to use classResolve with raw source fallback
- `boop.resolve` — public non-fatal resolution wrapper
- `boop.classPath` — full subcommand API (set/get/list/remove/has/dirs/rebuild)
- CFG serialization helper
- Filesystem fallback diagnostic

### Remaining Work

- **Test suite (`test_classpath_ts`)**: Dedicated test file exercising
  the classpath/namespace system end-to-end. Should cover: namespace
  resolution, index lookup, classPath overrides, rebuild, CFG round-trip,
  RC chain sourcing, BOOPPATH construction, deduplication, error cases.
  Add to `test_all` in the unit tests section.
- **Namespace directory migration**: Move existing flat class files into
  the namespace directory layout described below. Generate `.boopIndex`.
- **Remove `__boop_dir`**: ✓ Done. Declaration removed from `boop`.
- **Property-based tests**: Optional tasks from the spec (Properties 1-13).

### Design Reference

Core implementation complete. See DEVLOG.md for implementation notes
and prior art survey. The following sections document the design for
ongoing and future work.

### Prior Art (Cross-Language Survey)

| Language | Directory model | Env var | Key insight |
|----------|----------------|---------|-------------|
| Java | Package hierarchy: `com/example/geometry/Box.java` | `CLASSPATH` | Dirs = domain namespaces, never inheritance |
| Python | Package dirs with `__init__.py`: `geometry/box.py` | `PYTHONPATH` | Dirs = functional areas |
| Perl | `::` maps to dirs: `Geometry/Box.pm` = `Geometry::Box` | `PERL5LIB` | `@INC` searched per-root, depth-first |
| Ruby | Flat under `lib/`, namespace subdirs: `my_gem/widget.rb` | `RUBYLIB` | One class per file, module = folder |
| Lua | Template paths with `?`: `./?.lua` | `LUA_PATH` | String-based, no directory convention |

**Universal rule:** directories represent functional domains or
namespaces, never inheritance hierarchies. `Cube extends Box` —
they're siblings in the same namespace, not parent/child folders.

### Namespace Directory Convention

Follow the Perl model: `::` maps to directory separators. Every
class lives inside its namespace folder. The class file shares the
name of its innermost directory.

```
lib/
  Collection/
    Container/
      Container         # ← Collection::Container class
    List/
      List              # ← Collection::List class
    Map/
      Map               # ← Collection::Map class
    Set/
      Set               # ← Collection::Set (future)
  Math/
    Math                # ← Math class (namespace = class)
    Trig/
      Trig              # ← Math::Trig class
    Stats/
      Stats             # ← Math::Stats class
  Cards/
    Card/
      Card              # ← Cards::Card class
    Deck/
      Deck              # ← Cards::Deck class
    Hand/
      Hand              # ← Cards::Hand class
  IO/
    ...                 # ← future
```

**Rule:** when a namespace folder has a class with the same name
(e.g., `Math`), the class file lives *inside* the folder as
`Math/Math` — not outside it. The user still says `. boop Math`,
not `. boop Math::Math`. The import system handles this (see
resolution below).

### Short-Name Index — `.boopIndex`

A persisted file at each library root containing a `__boop_Index`
associative array mapping short class names to their full namespace
paths.

```bash
# .boopIndex — auto-generated, do not edit unless resolving conflicts
declare -gA __boop_Index=(
  [Container]="Collection::Container"
  [List]="Collection::List"
  [Map]="Collection::Map"
  [Math]="Math"
  [Trig]="Math::Trig"
  [Card]="Cards::Card"
  [Deck]="Cards::Deck"
  [Hand]="Cards::Hand"
)
```

**Auto-generation:** whenever a class is registered (via
`registerClass` or equivalent), the index is rebuilt. This can be
suppressed via configuration if the user wants manual control.

**Conflict handling:** if two namespaces both define a class with
the same short name (e.g., `Util` exists in both `IO::Util` and
`Math::Util`), that short name is *removed* from the index. Both
classes remain accessible by full namespace name. The conflict can
be explicitly resolved by manually adding the preferred mapping
back to `.boopIndex`.

**The index is a declaration, not a cache.** Filesystem fallback
hits do NOT auto-update the index. Only deliberate registration
events modify it. A successful fallback should emit `_Info`:
"List resolved via filesystem fallback — consider registering it."

### Multi-Root Resolution — Depth-First Per Root

`BOOPPATH` is a colon-delimited list of library roots (same format
as `PATH`, same naming convention as `GOPATH`/`MANPATH`). Each
root is a complete boop library with its own `.boopIndex`, its own
namespace tree, its own `.booprc`/`.boop.cfg`. Resolution is
**depth-first by default** — exhaust all resolution strategies
within one root before moving to the next.

**Root list construction** (in order):
1. `__boop_dir` — where `boop` itself lives (always first)
2. `BOOPPATH` entries — left to right

**Per-root resolution** (for each root, in order):
1. `__boop_classPath["ClassName"]` — explicit per-class override
   (nuclear option, always wins within this root)
2. `.boopIndex` lookup — short name → full namespace → filesystem
   path via namespace convention (`Collection::List` → 
   `root/Collection/List/List`)
3. `Name/Name` — filesystem convention fallback (directory + 
   same-named file inside it)
4. `Name` — bare file fallback (legacy/flat layout)

**Cross-root behavior:**
```
for each root in [__boop_dir, BOOPPATH...]:
  try per-root resolution (steps 1–4)
  found? → stop, use it
  not found? → next root

all roots exhausted → PATH fallback (bash native source)
still not found → _Crash
```

This enables **version layering**: `BOOPPATH="/opt/boop/v2:
/opt/boop/v1"` means v2 is checked first. If v2 has `Math` but
not `Math::Stats`, v1's `Math::Stats` fills the gap. Multiple
complete installs at different versions, searched in priority order.

**Customizable search strategy:** depth-first (exhaust one root
before trying the next) is the default. The search strategy is
configurable for future needs (e.g., breadth-first: check all
indexes first across all roots, then all filesystem conventions,
etc.). Default is depth-first because it gives the most predictable
"this root wins" behavior.

### Two-File Convention — `.booprc` + `.boop.cfg`

Separation of concerns: human-editable config vs machine-managed
structured data.

**`.booprc`** — user-editable bash script (like `.bashrc`). Can
contain arbitrary bash: log level overrides, custom hooks, env
setup, whatever the user wants. Its job is to source `.boop.cfg`
and add any hand-written customizations on top.

**`.boop.cfg`** — machine-managed, never hand-edited. Contains
structured declarations serialized by `boop.classPath` and future
config methods. Pure data — hash assignments, array entries, no
procedural logic. Always a complete serialization of current state,
not an append log. Rewritten in full on every mutation.

Three tiers, sourced in order of increasing precedence (later
values override earlier ones):

1. `/etc/booprc` (+ `/etc/boop.cfg`) — system-wide defaults
2. `~/.booprc` (+ `~/.boop.cfg`) — user-global preferences
3. `./.booprc` (+ `./.boop.cfg`) — project-local overrides

Files that don't exist are silently skipped. Same precedence model
as `.gitconfig` (system → global → local).

A typical `~/.booprc`:
```bash
# Source machine-managed config (classPath registrations, etc.)
[[ -f ~/.boop.cfg ]] && . ~/.boop.cfg

# User customizations
_LogLevel debug Math    # verbose logging for Math during dev
_OutMode stdout         # prefer stdout for CLI scripts
```

A typical `~/.boop.cfg` (written by `boop.classPath`, not by hand):
```bash
# Auto-generated by boop.classPath — do not edit manually
__boop_classPath["MyUtils"]="/home/user/lib/MyUtils"
__boop_classPath["GameEngine"]="/opt/boop-libs/GameEngine"
```

### `__boop.loader` — RC Discovery and Sourcing

Internal method responsible for the rc file bootstrap sequence.
Called once during `boop` initialization, after globals are declared
but before import arguments are processed.

Responsibilities:
- Source `/etc/booprc`, `~/.booprc`, `./.booprc` in order
- Each rc file is responsible for sourcing its own `.boop.cfg`
- Skip missing files silently
- Errors in rc files crash with a clear message pointing at the
  offending file and line
- Parse `BOOPPATH` env var — split on colons, validate
  directories exist, build the root list
- Source `.boopIndex` from each root in the root list
- Emit `_Info` diagnostics for each file sourced

Open question: should `.booprc` files be allowed to import classes
(`. boop SomeClass`)? Probably yes — a project rc might want to
pre-register and pre-load utility classes. Circular risk is low
(rc files aren't class files) but worth noting.

### `boop.classPath` — Public API and Configuration Serializer

Tier 3 public method. Two roles: runtime manipulation of the class
path registry, and serialization of state back to `.boop.cfg`.

Subcommand pattern:

```bash
boop.classPath set  ClassName /path/to/file  # register + persist
boop.classPath get  ClassName                # query → path or empty
boop.classPath list                          # dump all registrations
boop.classPath remove ClassName              # unregister + rewrite
boop.classPath has  ClassName                # test → exit code 0/1
boop.classPath dirs                          # list roots in order
boop.classPath rebuild                       # regenerate .boopIndex
```

**Serialization behavior** (`set`, `remove`, `rebuild`):
- Updates the live `__boop_classPath` hash immediately
- Rewrites `~/.boop.cfg` (default) as a complete serialization
- Target cfg file overridable: `_CfgFile=./.boop.cfg` for
  project-local persistence
- `rebuild` scans the namespace tree and regenerates `.boopIndex`,
  detecting and removing conflicting short names

**Validation on `set`**:
- Class name must pass `__boop.validate` (identifier rules)
- Path must exist and be a readable file (`[[ -f && -r ]]`)
- Overwriting an existing registration emits `_Info`, not an error

Returns via `boop.pass` so `into=` works naturally.

### Namespace-to-Filesystem Mapping

The `::` separator maps to `/` on disk. The class file shares the
name of its innermost namespace segment and lives inside a directory
of the same name.

| User says | Namespace | Filesystem path |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| `Math` | `Math` | `root/Math/Math` |
| `Math::Trig` | `Math::Trig` | `root/Math/Trig/Trig` |
| `List` | `Collection::List` | `root/Collection/List/List` (via index) |
| `Collection::List` | `Collection::List` | `root/Collection/List/List` (direct) |

**Import resolution for a bare name like `List`:**
1. Check `__boop_classPath["List"]` — explicit override
2. Check `__boop_Index["List"]` — finds `Collection::List` →
   resolve to `root/Collection/List/List`
3. Check `root/List/List` — filesystem convention
4. Check `root/List` — bare file fallback
5. Next root (repeat 1–4)
6. `PATH` fallback
7. `_Crash`

### Implementation Notes

- `__boop.loader` runs inside the `(( ! __boop_loaded ))` guard —
  fires once per process
- RC files are sourced (not executed) — they share the shell context
- Public API methods registered via `__boop.registerMethod` on the
  root `boop` class
- `boop.classPath set` does NOT trigger an immediate import —
  registration and loading are separate concerns
- The `::` separator is already reserved in the TODO for mixins/
  classlets/multiple-inheritance. Namespace usage here is compatible:
  `::` in import context means namespace, `::` in dispatch context
  means mixin provenance. No collision — they operate in different
  phases (load time vs call time).
- `.boopIndex` should be `.gitignore`-able for projects that prefer
  explicit full-namespace imports only

### Canonical Directory Layout

The repo *is* the library — no `lib/` wrapper. The install target
is a single directory containing `boop` and all namespace folders.
Tests and docs live alongside but are not part of the runtime
library.

```
<install_root>/                # e.g., /usr/local/lib/boop/
  boop                         # framework entry point
  .boopIndex                   # auto-generated short-name index
  .booprc                      # optional project-level rc
  .boop.cfg                    # optional project-level cfg
  Collection/
    Container/
      Container                # Collection::Container
    List/
      List                     # Collection::List
    Map/
      Map                      # Collection::Map
    Iterator/
      Iterator                 # Collection::Iterator
  Geometry/
    Box/
      Box                      # Geometry::Box
    Cube/
      Cube                     # Geometry::Cube
  Math/
    Math                       # Math (namespace = class)
  Games/
    Card/
      Card                     # Games::Card
    PlayingCard/
      PlayingCard              # Games::PlayingCard
    Deck/
      Deck                     # Games::Deck
    Blackjack/
      Blackjack                # Games::Blackjack (executable)
      BlackjackHand/
        BlackjackHand          # Games::Blackjack::BlackjackHand
  Testing/
    TestSuite/
      TestSuite                # Testing::TestSuite

    test_matrix
    test_pi_growth
    test_smoke
    test_stress_ts
    test_testsuite_ts
    boop_install               # bootstrap installer
  docs/                        # not part of the library
    ...
```

### `boop_install` — Bootstrap Script

A standalone install script that sets up boop on a fresh system.

Responsibilities:
- Copy (or symlink) the library tree to the install target
  (default: `/usr/local/lib/boop/` or user-specified location)
- Create a symlink in a PATH directory (default:
  `/usr/local/bin/boop` → `<install_root>/boop`) so that
  `. boop` works from anywhere
- Generate the initial `.boopIndex` by scanning the namespace tree
- Create a starter `~/.booprc` if one doesn't exist (with the
  `.boop.cfg` source line and commented-out examples)
- Verify bash version (5.0+ required)
- Detect existing installations and offer upgrade/overwrite
- Support `--prefix`, `--symlink`, `--no-rc` flags for
  customization
- Emit clear success/failure messages

The symlink is the bootstrap: it puts `boop` on PATH, and `boop`
resolves `__boop_dir` via `realpath` on `BASH_SOURCE[0]`, which
follows the symlink back to the real install root. From there,
everything else is discoverable.

Uninstall: remove the symlink and the install directory. The rc
files in `~/` and `/etc/` are left alone (user data).

Source: `boop` (import section, initialization), all class files.

## ★ Meta-Components and Graceful Degradation

**Priority item.** The core (`boop`) should define well-known
extension points that optional meta-components can fill. If a
meta-component is installed, the core uses it. If not, the core
emits `_Warn` and carries on with reduced functionality. Sane
defaults, customizable behavior.

This is the "limp along without" pattern -- the core never hard-
depends on anything outside itself, but it gets smarter when
optional tools are present.

### Motivating Use Cases

- **`require Math 1.2+`** -- version-gated class loading. Needs
  a SemVer parser to enforce the constraint. If SemVer isn't
  available, warn and load without checking.

- **`loadClass Math _Out=stdout version=1.2+`** -- per-class
  arguments at load time. Needs ArgParser to parse key=value
  args. If ArgParser isn't available, warn and fall back to
  bare-name loading.

- **Class version declarations** -- classes declare their version
  in their descriptor (via `boopClass`). `require` checks it
  after loading. Without SemVer, the version is stored but never
  enforced.

### Candidate Meta-Components

| Component | What it enables | Fallback without it |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|
| **SemVer** | Version parsing, comparison, range matching | Warn, skip version checks |
| **ArgParser** | key=value, positional, flag parsing for constructors and methods | Warn, ignore args / use current ad-hoc loops |
| **Help** | `--help` on classes, auto-generated from descriptors | Warn, no help output |

### Design Principles

- Meta-components live in the standard namespace tree like any
  other class. They're loaded via the normal import path.
- The core checks for their presence at the point of use, not at
  init time. Lazy detection -- no startup penalty.
- Detection is a simple registry check:
  `[[ -n "${__boop_registry[SemVer]+set}" ]]`
- The warn-and-continue behavior is the default. A user who wants
  strict enforcement can set `_FatalLevel warn` and missing
  meta-components become fatal.
- Each extension point has a well-defined interface the core
  codes against. The meta-component implements that interface.
  Swappable implementations are possible (e.g., a lightweight
  SemVer vs a full-featured one).

### Relationship to Existing TODO Items

- **Argument-Parsing Object** -- becomes the ArgParser meta-component
- **Version Declaration** -- becomes SemVer meta-component + class
  version property + `require` function
- **Class File Execution Guard & Help System** -- becomes the Help
  meta-component
- **Inline Arguments on Class Load** -- enabled by ArgParser

### Open Questions

- Should `require` be a function or a keyword in the source line?
  `require Math 1.2+` vs `. boop require:Math:1.2+`
- How do classes declare their version? Property in `boopClass`
  call? Separate `declare`?
- Should meta-components be auto-loaded on first use, or must the
  user explicitly import them?
- Can meta-components depend on each other? (ArgParser probably
  doesn't need SemVer, but `require` might need both.)

Needs a full spec pass before implementation.

## `::` Syntax -- Mixins, Classlets, and Multiple Inheritance

The `::` separator is conventional in bash for namespaced functions
(`mylib::init`). boop doesn't use it — dots handle class.method
dispatch. That frees `::` for a new role.

Three potential applications, possibly overlapping:

### Mixins / Traits ("Classlets")

Bundles of methods without constructors or state — `Serializable`,
`Comparable`, `Printable`. Not full classes, just method sets you
mix into a real class on demand. The `::` identifies provenance:
`Serializable::save` is the `save` method provided by the
`Serializable` mixin, distinguishing it from any `save` the class
defines itself.

### Lazy Sub-Modules

`Math::Trig` loads trig functions only when first touched. It
doesn't inherit from Math — it extends Math's surface area on
demand. The `::` signals "sub-module of" without implying an
inheritance relationship. Could hook into the existing lazy
stub/bake mechanism: first call to `Math::Trig.sin` triggers
the load.

### Multiple Inheritance Disambiguation

If A inherits from both B and C, and both provide `method`,
`B::A.method` specifies which lineage to resolve through.
Similar to C++'s `Base::method()` — explicit, no magic, the
programmer picks the path. Avoids Python-style MRO linearization
complexity.

Open questions:
- Does `::` participate in dispatch, or is it purely a source-time
  resolution hint?
- Can classlets have state (properties), or are they method-only?
- How does `isa` work with mixins? `$obj.isa Serializable`?
- Performance: does this add overhead to the hot path, or is it
  resolved at bake time and free thereafter?

This is a design exploration — no implementation yet.

## Load Guard & Class Init Refactor

The current load guard pattern in every class file:

```bash
[[ -n "${__boop_registry[ClassName]+set}" ]] && return 2>/dev/null
```

Has two problems:

1. The `return` silently fails when the file is executed directly
   (not sourced), and `2>/dev/null` hides the error. Under `set -e`
   this is a silent fatal exit with no explanation.

2. There's no help output — running `bash Box` does nothing useful.

Planned replacement: a `boop.init` method on the root class that
handles the load guard, detects direct execution, and prints help text.
Design includes per-class help via `__boop_help["ClassName"]`,
inheritable defaults, and a single-statement call pattern in class
files. Details still under discussion.

See also: "Class File Execution Guard & Help System" (below).

Source: `boop`, all class files.

## Args — CLI Argument Parser ★ IN PROGRESS

Two entry points, one class. Implementation at `Args/Args`.

### `Args.getOpts` — POSIX short options (thin getopts wrapper)
```bash
Args.getOpts ":vf:" "$@"
shift $((OPTIND-1))
# Sets: $v=1 (boolean), $f=<value> (value-taking)
# $__Args_orig holds original args array
```
Leading `:` in optstr = silent error mode. Value-taking options (letter`:`) get
the value; booleans get `"1"`. Unknown option or missing value → `_Crash`.
Caller must `shift $((OPTIND-1))` after to consume processed args.

### `Args.parse` — GNU long + subcommand parser

Schema is an INI-style string passed as the first argument.

```bash
Args.parse '
[Use]
  ${0##*/} [options] ACTION [args]

[Options]
  verbose | v                       # boolean flag → $verbose
  output | o = /tmp/out.txt         # value-taking, with default → $output
  : required | r =                  # required, value-taking → $required

[Subcommands]
  deploy | d                        # canonical name is "deploy"
  rollback | rb

[deploy]
  env | e =                         # deploy-specific option → $env

[rollback]
  : version | ver =                 # required for rollback → $version
' "$@"
```

**Option line syntax** (left of `#` is parsed, right is help text):
- `[: ] varName [| alias...] [= [default] | :]`
- Leading `:` → required
- Trailing `=` → takes a value; `= default` sets the default
- Trailing `:` → takes a value (no default form)
- No sigil → boolean (absent=`""`, present=`"1"`)
- First entry = variable name (must be valid bash identifier, no hyphens)
- Additional entries = CLI aliases (may contain hyphens)
- Single-char entries map to `-x`; multi-char entries map to `--name`

**After parse (scope-write mode — no `into=`):**
- `$varName` set for each option (value or default or empty)
- `$_Action` = canonical subcommand name (or empty)
- `$_ArgsRemaining` = array of remaining positionals
- `$__Args_orig` = array of original args
- To restore `$@`: `set -- "${_ArgsRemaining[@]}"`

**Object mode (`into=args Args.parse schema "$@"`):**
- Returns a Config object. `_Require Config` called internally.
- Access: `$args.get varName`, `$args.get _action`, `$args.get _remaining`
- Scope vars are NOT set in object mode.

**Behavior:**
- `--` terminates option processing; remainder → `_ArgsRemaining`
- Short clustering: `-abc` = `-a -b -c`
- `-xVALUE` attaches value to short option within cluster
- Unknown option → `_Crash`
- Missing required value → `_Crash`
- Missing required option → `_Crash` (checked after full parse)
- All option sections (`[Options]`, `[subcommandName]`) contribute to the
  same alias pool. Subcommand-specific options are globally available
  (cross-subcommand validation is a future enhancement).

### What's done
- `Args/Args` — full implementation of both entry points
- `Config.fromString` — added to `Config/Config` (used by future tooling)

### What's pending
- `tests/unit/test_args_ts` — test file not yet written
- `tests/test_all` — needs `test_args_ts` in unit loop and `Args/Args` in naming check
- `--help` auto-generation from schema (deferred — needs description storage)
- Cross-subcommand option isolation (deferred — currently all options share alias pool)

---

## Argument-Parsing Object -- See Meta-Components

Now part of the ★ Meta-Components system. ArgParser becomes an
optional meta-component that the core can leverage for key=value
parsing in constructors, `loadClass`, and `require`. See that
section for the full design.

Original sketch:
```bash
into=args ArgParser "suit= rank= faceUp=0" "$@"
$args.get suit   # -> "spades"
$args.get faceUp # -> "0" (default)
```

Needs to handle: required vs optional, defaults, type validation,
positional fallback, unknown-key rejection.

---

## Inline Arguments on Class Load -- See Meta-Components

Now part of the ★ Meta-Components system. Enabled by the ArgParser
meta-component. See that section for the design.

Original idea: `. boop Math precision=128` passes key=value pairs
to the class during loading. The bulk-load form (`. boop Math Cube
List`) stays as-is.

---

## Class File Execution Guard & Help System

Class files like `Box`, `List`, etc. are meant to be sourced, not
executed directly. Currently running `bash Box` silently succeeds and
does nothing — confusing for users.

### Execution Guard

`__boop.registerClass` could detect when the class file is being
executed directly (`BASH_SOURCE` == `$0`) and respond appropriately:

- If the class has a flag indicating it's NOT meant to be executed
  directly (the common case), print a usage message and exit:
  `"Box is a class file. Source it with: . boop Box"`

- If the class IS meant to be executable (like `blackjack`), skip the
  guard and let the script continue to its main logic.

Flag could be a class property (`executable=false`) or a parameter to
`registerClass`.

### Help System

Classes should support a standard help interface. Running a class file
directly (or calling `ClassName --help` or `ClassName.help`) should
print a synopsis:

```
Box — 3D rectangular container

Properties:
  length, width, height — dimensions (integers)
  unit — measurement unit (optional)
  color — display color (optional)

Methods:
  volume  — returns length × width × height
  area    — returns 2D area of given dimensions
  top     — returns area of top face
  ...

Usage:
  . boop Box
  into=b Box length=5 width=3 height=7
  $b.volume  # → 105
```

This could be:
- Auto-generated from the class descriptor (methods, properties)
- Enhanced with a `description` property and per-method docstrings
- Stored in a `__boop_help` registry or inline in the descriptor

## Stderr Redirection Audit

Several places in the codebase use `2>/dev/null` to suppress errors.
Each should be reviewed:

- **Class file load guards** (`&& return 2>/dev/null`): Currently
  suppresses "return outside function" error. Should be replaced with
  `BASH_SOURCE` vs `$0` check to only return when sourced. See
  "Class File Execution Guard" above.

- **TestSuite assert_ok/assert_fail**: Suppresses stderr from the
  command being tested. This hides real errors — should probably let
  stderr through and capture it for the failure message.

- **boop import fallback** (`. "$__import_class" 2>/dev/null`):
  Suppresses "file not found" before the crash message. Borderline —
  crash message is more informative, but original error has path info.

Principle: Only suppress stderr when you know exactly what the error
will be, you're expecting it, and the content has no debugging value.

---

## Security: Parse Config Files as Data, Not Code

Currently `.boopIndex` and `.boop.cfg` are sourced as bash scripts.
This means a malicious or corrupted file can execute arbitrary code
during framework initialization. The current trust model matches
`.bashrc` (if an attacker can write your config, you're already
compromised), but we should harden this.

Goal: convert `.boopIndex` and `.boop.cfg` from sourced scripts to
parsed data files. Read them line by line, extract key=value pairs
via parameter expansion, populate the arrays manually. No `eval`,
no `source`, no code execution.

`.booprc` remains a sourced bash script by design — it's explicitly
user code. The hardening applies only to machine-managed files
(`.boopIndex`, `.boop.cfg`) where the content is structured and
predictable.

Implementation:
- Write a `__boop.parseConfig` function that reads a file and
  populates a named associative array from `key=value` lines
- Ignore blank lines and `#` comments
- Reject lines that don't match the expected pattern (emit `_Warn`)
- Use this for `.boopIndex` and `.boop.cfg` instead of sourcing
- The file format stays the same (valid bash syntax) so it's
  still human-readable and backward-compatible if someone does
  source it manually

Priority: low (current trust model is adequate). Do this when
the framework is mature enough to worry about hostile environments.

---

## Inline Class Definitions in Executable Scripts ✓

The `BASH_SOURCE[0]` vs `$0` guard is the pattern. After `boopClass`
registration, add:

```bash
[[ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" != "${0}" ]] && return 0
# main logic here — only runs when executed directly, not sourced
```

`blackjack` demonstrates this: sourcing it loads `BlackjackHand` for
tests; executing it runs the game. No separate class file needed.

See also: "Class File Execution Guard" section above for the remaining
work (auto-help when sourced-as-executed without this guard).

## Generalize Card/Deck/Hand Classes ✓ → DEVLOG

---

## Signal Handler Class

A class for registering at-exit and on-error callbacks into a managed
stack. Bash's `trap` only allows one handler per signal — this class
would layer a callback stack on top of it, so multiple components can
register cleanup/error behaviors without stomping each other.

Core interface:
- `onExit callback` — push a function onto the EXIT handler stack
- `onError callback` — push a function onto the ERR handler stack
- `remove callback` — pull a specific callback off the stack
- Stack executes LIFO on signal (last registered runs first)

Natural consumer of the Stack class (Phase 2). Could also support
arbitrary signals beyond EXIT/ERR if the design generalizes cleanly.

---

## Stack Class (Phase 2)

Classic LIFO collection. Constrain List: expose `push`, `pop`, `peek`,
`isEmpty`. Hide `shift`, `unshift`, `get`-by-index.

Source: PLAN.md Phase 2.

---

## Queue Class (Phase 2)

Classic FIFO collection. Expose `enqueue` (push), `dequeue` (shift),
`peek`, `isEmpty`. Possibly `size`.

Source: PLAN.md Phase 2.

---

## LinkedList Class (Phase 2)

Each node is itself an object (or a Map entry). Requires `insertAt`,
`removeAt`, `next`/`prev` traversal. Decide whether doubly-linked is
worth the complexity at this stage. @@

Source: PLAN.md Phase 2.

---

## Set Class (Phase 2)

Unique unordered collection. Implement on top of Map keys — values are
irrelevant, keys are the members. Expose `add`, `has`, `remove`,
`toArray`, `union`, `intersect`. Arguably simpler than LinkedList.

Source: PLAN.md Phase 2.

---

## Map::Fast -- Flat Compound-Key Store

A purpose-built flat associative array with compound keys for O(1)
point lookups. Tuned for config data, parsed documents, lookup
tables, and caches. Explicitly not good at enumeration, subtree
deletion, or length queries -- use Map for those.

### Design

Internally a single bash associative array. Keys are dot-delimited
compound paths: `users.0.name`, `server.port`, `db.host`. Values
are always strings (which can be object references if needed).

```bash
into=doc Map::Fast
$doc.set "server.host" "localhost"
$doc.set "server.port" "8080"
into=h $doc.get "server.host"       # "localhost" -- one hash lookup
```

### Key Separator

Use a separator that can't appear in natural keys. Default `.`,
overridable per-instance. Consider `\x1F` (unit separator) for
data where dots are legitimate key content.

### Optional Prefix Indexing

A toggle that maintains a prefix index for `keys("users.*")`
style queries. Off by default -- pay for what you use. When on,
set/delete operations update the index automatically.

### Tradeoffs (document explicitly)

- O(1) get/set by full path
- Enumeration requires scanning all keys (slow for large stores)
- Subtree deletion requires prefix scan
- No pass-by-reference for subtrees (pass doc + prefix path)
- No insertion order guarantee

### Status

✓ Initial implementation complete (`Collection/Map/Fast/Fast`).
Loadable via `Fast` (short name, index) or `Collection::Map::Fast`
(full namespace). `Map::Fast` (partial namespace) does NOT resolve --
see Namespace Resolution below.

---

## Partial Namespace Resolution

`Map::Fast` normalizes to `Map/Fast` but the resolver doesn't
check the index for the first segment and append the rest. Today
the index maps whole short names (`Fast` -> `Collection/Map/Fast`),
not namespace prefixes.

Options:
1. Teach the resolver to split on `/`, check the index for the
   first segment, and resolve the remainder against that root.
   `Map::Fast` -> index says `Map` is `Collection/Map` -> try
   `Collection/Map/Fast/Fast` (R1) then `Collection/Map/Fast` (bare).
2. Allow the index to contain compound entries:
   `[Map::Fast]="Collection/Map/Fast"`
3. Standardize that partial namespaces are not supported -- always
   use the full path or the short name.

Option 1 is the most natural. Needs a spec pass to handle edge
cases (what if the first segment isn't in the index? what about
three-level partials?).

---

## ★ Fully Qualified Class Names and Import Aliasing

**Priority item.** The class system currently uses short names
everywhere: registry keys, method names, baked wrappers, constructor
shorthands. `Box.volume`, `Math.add`, `List.push`. This works only
because every class has a unique short name today.

As soon as two namespaces define a class with the same short name
(`Geometry::Box` and `Sport::Box`, or `Map::Fast` and `JSON::Fast`),
everything collides: registry entries, method function names, baked
wrappers, constructor shorthands.

### The Java Import Model

Classes should register with their full qualified name internally:
`Geometry.Box`, `Collection.Map.Fast`. Method functions use the
full name: `Geometry.Box.volume`, `Collection.Map.Fast.get`.

But casual use should still allow short names when unambiguous.
`_Import Geometry::Box` (or a similar mechanism) creates a local
alias so the user can write `Box.new` and it resolves to
`Geometry.Box.new`. If both `Geometry::Box` and `Sport::Box` are
loaded, the user must use the full name for at least one.

### What Needs to Change

- `boopClass` registers with full qualified name
- Method functions use full qualified name
- Baked wrappers map short name -> full name (the alias layer)
- Constructor shorthands use the alias
- `_Import` (new Tier 2 function) creates short-name aliases
  after loading, similar to Java's `import` statement
- The index maps short names to full names (already does this)
- Conflict detection removes ambiguous short aliases (already does)
- `boop.classPath set` provides manual alias overrides (already does)

### Backward Compatibility

Existing classes with unique short names (`Box`, `Math`, `List`)
continue to work as-is -- their full name happens to equal their
short name (or the alias is unambiguous). The refactor is additive
for existing code.

### Open Questions

- Does `_Import` create aliases in the current shell scope, or
  globally? Global is simpler but means one script's imports
  affect another's.
- Should `_Import` support `_Import Geometry::Box as GBox`?
- How do per-class method names interact with inheritance?
  If `Geometry.Box` inherits from `boop`, is the parent method
  `boop.get` or `Geometry.Box.get`?
- Internal variable naming: `__Geometry_Box_volume_result` or
  `__GeometryBox_volume_result`?

Needs a full spec pass. This is the biggest remaining architectural
decision in the framework.

---

## JSON Parser

Two-stage pipeline: fast flat parse, optional deep conversion.

### `JSON.parse` (default -- flat)

Parses JSON into a `Map::Fast` with compound keys. One hash
lookup per value access. No object-per-node overhead.

```bash
into=doc JSON.parse '{"users":[{"name":"Alice"},{"name":"Bob"}]}'
into=name $doc.get "users.0.name"    # "Alice"
into=port $doc.get "server.port"     # "8080"
```

This is the 90% use case: grab values by path from parsed data.

### `JSON.parseDeep` (full object tree)

Takes a `Map::Fast` (or raw JSON) and inflates it into real
Map/List objects. Each node is a proper boop object you can
pass around, iterate, hand to functions.

```bash
into=tree JSON.parseDeep "$doc"      # or JSON.parseDeep '{"..."}'
into=users $tree.get "users"         # a real List object
$users.each show_user               # iterate with callbacks
```

Two-stage: parse flat first, deep-convert only if needed.

### `JSON.stringify`

Serializes a Map::Fast or Map/List tree back to JSON string.

### Implementation Notes

- Pure bash string walking with parameter expansion for tokenization
- No external dependencies (no jq, no python)
- Handles: objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, null
- Nested structures map to compound keys with `.` separator
- Array indices are numeric: `users.0`, `users.1`
- Would benefit from String class but not blocked on it

---

## YAML / XML Parsers (Future)

YAML: indentation-sensitive, harder than JSON. Consider a subset
parser (flat key-value, simple lists) before attempting full spec.

XML: attributes + content + nesting. Significantly more complex.
May not be worth pure-bash implementation -- consider requiring
an external tool as an optional dependency.

Both deferred until JSON is proven and Map::Fast is stable.

---

## _Static Helper ✓ DONE

Implemented as three Tier 2 helpers:

- `_Me` -- returns object ID (`_Self`) or class name, defaulting to `boop`
- `_Static k=v` / `_Static k` -- per-method storage, key includes function name
- `_Property k=v` / `_Property k` -- per-object/class storage, no function name

All use `__boop_static` as the backing store. Keys are auto-generated
compound paths ensuring isolation between methods and objects.

---

## String Class (Phase 3)

Heavy string work is happening natively everywhere. A proper wrapper
would clean up downstream code and give callers a consistent interface.

Minimum useful interface: `trim`, `split`, `join`, `contains`,
`startsWith`, `endsWith`, `replace`, `length`, `toUpper`, `toLower`,
`substring`.

All implementable in pure bash parameter expansion — no forks, no
subshells. Fits the no-external-dependencies philosophy.

Source: PLAN.md Phase 3.

---

## BOOPPATH ✓ → DEVLOG (subsumed by Classpath/Namespace system)

## Version Declaration → See Meta-Components (SemVer component)

---

## I/O Classes (Phase 5)

All implementable in pure bash using persistent file descriptors —
no forks, no subshells, no external tools. Fits the zero-fork philosophy.

### File

Wraps a persistent file descriptor opened with `exec {fd}<>file`.
Avoids the open/close overhead of re-reading files per call.

```bash
into=f File.open "/var/log/app.log" mode=append
$f.write "event: $data"
$f.readLine   # reads next line via read -r -u $fd
$f.close
```

Interface: `open`, `close`, `read`, `readLine`, `readAll`
(`mapfile -t arr -u $fd`), `write`, `seek`, `tell`, `eof`.

### Buffer

Accumulates writes in a string variable, flushes on demand or at
a size threshold. Zero I/O cost for buffered writes; one write
per flush.

```bash
into=buf Buffer.new
$buf.append "line one\n"
$buf.append "line two\n"
$buf.flush   # one write to FD/file
$buf.toString
```

### Pipe

Bidirectional in-memory channel using bash's `exec {rfd}<> <(...)` or
a named FIFO. Useful for producer/consumer patterns within a script
without spawning subprocesses.

Needs design work — bash FD plumbing for in-process pipes is finicky.
Start with named FIFOs (`mkfifo`) as the backing store; revisit for
anonymous pipe options.

### Read utilities

`mapfile`/`readarray` for bulk line-array reads. `read -t 0` for
non-blocking poll. `read -N n` for exact byte counts. Wrap these
as static methods on a `IO` namespace class so callers don't need
to remember the flags.

Source: PLAN.md Phase 5.

---

## Config Class ✓

A Config object that reads and writes structured config files in pure
bash. Two formats, one interface.

### Property file (flat key=value)

Same format as `.boop.cfg` — one `key=value` per line, `#` comments,
blank lines ignored. Keys are top-level; no sections.

```bash
into=cfg Config.load ~/.myapp.cfg
$cfg.get theme          # → "dark"
$cfg.set theme light
$cfg.save ~/.myapp.cfg  # rewrite in place
```

### INI file

`[section]` headers divide key=value groups. Keys are stored
internally as `section.key` so the same get/set/has interface works
for both formats. Section name `""` (empty) is the implicit top-level
for keys before the first header.

```bash
into=cfg Config.loadINI /etc/myapp.ini
$cfg.get database.host  # → "localhost"
$cfg.get database.port  # → "5432"
$cfg.keys database      # → "host port user password"
$cfg.sections           # → "database server logging"
```

### Interface

```
Config.load file        → new Config object backed by property file
Config.loadINI file     → new Config object backed by INI file
Config.new              → empty Config object (no file)
$cfg.get key            → value or empty string
$cfg.set key val        → update in memory
$cfg.has key            → exit code 0/1
$cfg.keys [section]     → space-separated key list
$cfg.sections           → section list (INI only)
$cfg.save [file]        → write current state back
$cfg.toINI [file]       → write as INI format
$cfg.toFlat [file]      → write as flat key=value
```

### Implementation notes

- Backed by a per-object associative array `__boop_config_${_Self}`
  (same pattern as Map's companion storage).
- `Config.load` / `Config.loadINI` parse with a `while IFS= read -r`
  loop — pure bash, zero forks. Regex matching for `[section]` headers
  and `key=value` lines via `[[ =~ ]]`.
- Keys in flat files stored as-is. Keys in INI files stored as
  `section.key`; the section prefix is stripped by `$cfg.get` when
  a bare key is given and it matches exactly one section.
- `$cfg.save` rewrites the file entirely (not append). Preserves
  comments from the original file if they were captured during load.
  (Comment preservation is optional / Phase 2.)
- Deliberately does NOT `source` the file — pure data parsing, no
  code execution. See "Security: Parse Config Files as Data" section.

Implementation complete: `Config/Config`, 71 tests in `tests/unit/test_config_ts`.

Source: discussed as extension of .boop.cfg concept.

## Return System Filesystem Mode

`boop.passPath` — use call stack introspection to determine a
filesystem-backed return path. Would allow returning data via temp files
instead of variables, useful for large payloads.

Consider: `_File` as a Tier 2 inherited var on `boop.pass` for explicit
file output. Would unify the filesystem mode with a user-friendly
inline pattern (`_File="/var/log/app.log" _Warn "something"`). Open
questions around precedence (`into=` vs `_File` vs mode), whether it
replaces the current filesystem mode or layers on top, and how much
the framework should manage output streams vs leaving that to the user.
Don't overthink it — users can always manage their own redirects.

## Housekeeping ✓ → DEVLOG

## Extensive Logging Hooks Throughout Codebase

The logging system exists (`_Error`, `_Warn`, `_Info`, `_Debug`,
`_Trace`) but most of the codebase doesn't use it. The framework
needs comprehensive logging instrumentation so that turning up the
log level actually reveals what's happening.

Priority areas:

- **`__boop.import`** — log every resolution step: which root is
  being searched, which strategy matched (classPath, index,
  filesystem, bare file), what file was sourced. At `_Debug` level.
  At `_Trace`, log the full root list and index contents.

- **`__boop.loader`** — log each rc/cfg file sourced or skipped,
  `BOOPPATH` parsing results, index loading. `_Info` level.

- **`boop.classPath`** — log every `set`, `remove`, `rebuild`
  operation including what was written and where. `_Info` level.

- **Object lifecycle** — `__boop.new` and `destroy` should log
  object creation/destruction at `_Debug`. Constructor arguments
  at `_Trace`.

- **Method dispatch** — `registerClass` wrapper generation,
  MRO cache hits/misses, inherited method resolution. `_Debug`
  for cache misses, `_Trace` for every dispatch.

- **Property access** — `__boop.get`/`__boop.set` at `_Trace`
  level. Too noisy for anything less.

- **`boop.pass`** — log mode selection and target variable at `_Trace`.
  Subshell footgun `_Debug` already added (into= in subshell emits advisory).

- **Class files** — each class's `.new()` should log construction
  at `_Debug`. Complex methods (Container iteration, Math
  arithmetic) should log entry/exit at `_Trace`.

Principle: `_Info` shows lifecycle events (loaded X, sourced Y).
`_Debug` shows decisions (chose this path because...). `_Trace`
shows everything (every get/set, every dispatch, every argument).
A user debugging a resolution issue should be able to set
`_LogLevel trace` and see the complete story.

Source: `boop`, all class files.

### Log-Level Bypass via Function Replacement (Performance)

When `_LogLevel` is set high (e.g. `ERROR`), every `_Warn`, `_Info`,
`_Debug`, and `_Trace` call still pays the cost of a function invocation
that immediately returns. At high call volume this adds up.

**Mechanism: function replacement, not aliases.** Aliases don't expand
inside function bodies in non-interactive shells. The correct approach
is to overwrite the silenced functions with no-op bodies at `_LogLevel`
change time:

```bash
# Inside __boop.setLogLevel, after updating __boop_logLevel:
_Trace() { :; }
(( __boop_logLevel >= __boop_LOG_DEBUG )) || _Debug() { :; }
(( __boop_logLevel >= __boop_LOG_INFO  )) || _Info()  { :; }
(( __boop_logLevel >= __boop_LOG_WARN  )) || _Warn()  { :; }
# Restore real implementations for active levels (re-source or eval)
```

`:` is a bash builtin — the cheapest possible no-op. Plain string args
still get evaluated before the call (bash evaluates args before dispatch),
but that's only significant if the message involves a subshell — which
it shouldn't, per our no-subshell policy.

For expensive message construction in hot paths, use an inline guard
at the call site to skip arg evaluation entirely:

```bash
(( __boop_logLevel >= __boop_LOG_DEBUG )) && _Debug "hot-path detail: $val"
```

Caveats:
- Must restore real implementations when `_LogLevel` rises again
- Benchmark: re-defining N functions per level change should be
  negligible vs the per-call savings on stable long-running scripts
- Per-class log levels complicate this — function replacement is global,
  but per-class checks happen inside `__boop.log`. Consider whether
  the bypass applies only when the GLOBAL level silences a tier (per-class
  overrides can still route through the real function).

---

## Per-Class Work

---

### boop (root class)

- **`setOn` coverage**: method exists, test coverage unclear
- **`boop_install` bootstrap script**: puts boop on PATH, generates
  initial `.boopIndex`, creates starter `~/.booprc`. See Classpath
  section for full spec.
- **`boop.inspect`**: pretty-print an object's full state for debugging.
  Should show class, inheritance chain, all properties with current
  values, and method list. Registered on root `boop` class so every
  object inherits it. Tier 3 public, output to stdout by default.
  ```
  [Box _abc123]
    class:  Box (extends boop)
    length: 5
    width:  3
    height: 7
    methods: new, volume, area, top, side, front, toString
  ```
- **Scaffolding (`boop new MyClass`)**: generate a class file skeleton
  from a template. Could live as a subcommand on the `boop` root class
  or as a standalone `boop_new` script. Output is a ready-to-edit file
  with load guard, boopClass declaration, and stub `.new()`. High
  friction reducer for new users.

---

### Math

Math uses chunked arbitrary-precision arithmetic entirely in bash —
no forks, no subshells, no external tools. 9 digits per chunk, base
10^9, fits in int64. `printf -v` for all string formatting.
All returns via nameref. See `Math/Math` header for algorithm notes.

- **Input validation on public API**: `Math.add`, `Math.subtract`,
  etc. accept garbage strings without complaint — error surfaces deep
  in `__Math.toInt64` as a cryptic `10#` bash arithmetic error.
  Validation belongs in `__Math.resolve` (single chokepoint). After
  parsing, verify digits are all-digit; crash with helpful message.

- **Variadic public methods**: `Math.add 1 2 3 4` should sum all
  args. `Math.add 5` (single arg) should return identity. Same for
  `mul`. Currently requires exactly two operands.

- **Output format modes**: scientific notation (`3.14e10`), engineering
  notation, fixed decimal places. Currently outputs raw digit string
  with implicit decimal position. Needs a `Math.format` or `format=`
  typecast option on results.

- **`Math::Trig` submodule**: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `asin`, `acos`,
  `atan`, `atan2`. Already have `arctan` series internally (used for
  pi). Expose as a loadable submodule. No forks — same digit-math
  approach as `pi`.

- **`Math::Stats` submodule**: `mean`, `median`, `stddev`, `variance`,
  `min`, `max`, `sum`. Operates on List or array of Math objects.

---

### Collection (Container, List, Map, Iterator)

- **Iterator stability after mutation**: behavior when the underlying
  container is modified during iteration is undefined. Document the
  contract or enforce it (crash on structural modification).

- **Container test coverage audit**: 23 methods — valid usage,
  expected failures, garbage inputs. See Test Coverage Audit section.

- **List**: 15 methods — coverage audit. `insertAt`/`removeAt`
  needed for LinkedList compatibility.

- **Map**: 12 methods — coverage audit. Insertion-order guarantee
  should be documented explicitly (currently relies on bash 4.0+
  associative array ordering, which is NOT insertion-ordered —
  verify this is handled correctly).

---

### String (Phase 3)

Minimum useful interface, all in pure bash parameter expansion —
no forks, no subshells:

`trim`, `split`, `join`, `contains`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`,
`replace`, `replaceAll`, `length`, `toUpper`, `toLower`, `substring`,
`indexOf`, `padLeft`, `padRight`.

Heavy string work is already happening natively everywhere. A class
wrapper gives callers a consistent interface and makes complex string
pipelines readable.

---

### Games (Card, PlayingCard, Deck, Blackjack)

- **`test_blackjack` coverage**: test file exists but coverage depth
  unknown. Audit against all public methods.
- **Blackjack**: lives in `Games/Blackjack/` namespace. Hand scoring,
  soft/hard ace logic, split/double-down, dealer AI — currently
  all in the script. Consider whether any logic belongs in
  `BlackjackHand` class.

---

### Geometry (Box, Cube)

- **Box/Cube**: 91 tests passing, coverage looks solid. No known
  gaps. Revisit when new geometry classes are added.

---

## Test Coverage Audit

Every declared method in every class should have test coverage:

- Valid usage (expected inputs produce expected outputs)
- Expected failures (bad inputs crash with clear messages)
- Unexpected/garbage inputs (fails gracefully, not dramatically)

Classes with the most surface area to audit:
- Container (23 methods), Math (26 methods + static wrappers),
  List (15 methods), Map (12 methods), Iterator (8 methods)
- Card/Deck/Hand — `test_blackjack` exists but coverage is unknown
- boop root methods — `setOn` coverage unclear

Also: CLI-level testing for Tier 3 public methods. These need
creative adversarial input from a human who enjoys breaking things.

---


## Return System: Default to stdout + Newline Control ✓

✓ `auto` mode now always outputs to stdout. `_Out` global still
available via explicit `_OutMode=global`. All `test_stress_ts` call
sites updated to use `into=varname` or `$()` capture.

`into=` always wins regardless of mode. The mode only matters when
no explicit target is given.

### `into=` in Subshells — Known Silent Footgun

`into=varname $obj.method` inside a subshell silently loses the
value: the nameref write succeeds into the subshell's scope, stdout
is suppressed (nameref path returns early), and the value evaporates
when the subshell exits. No crash, no warning.

A blanket `_Warn` for "into= in subshell" would false-positive on
legitimate patterns (e.g., using `into=` inside a subshell to chain
intermediate calls before `printf`-ing the result out). Left as a
documentation note. The safe idioms are:

```bash
# Option 1: into= for intermediate work, printf the final result
result=$( into=tmp $obj.compute; printf "%s" "$tmp" )

# Option 2: subshell capture of stdout directly
result=$( $obj.compute )
```

### Per-Class / Per-Namespace Output Mode

Consider per-class output mode overrides, same pattern as the log
level system: global default, per-class overrides via an associative
array, inheritance through the class chain, cached resolution.

Use case: a CLI utility class might want stdout by default, while
a library class wants global. The class author sets the default,
the user can override per-class or globally.

### `into=` Forwarding Through Dispatchers ✓

✓ `_Delegate`, `_Super`, and `_Cast` now explicitly forward
`into="${into:-}"` to inner calls. Three new tests in
`test_stress_ts` cover the indirect forwarding case (outer caller
sets `into=`, inner method dispatches without its own `into=`).

## Implicit Object Declaration on Return (`_AS=`)

Explore whether `boop.pass` could auto-wrap a return value as an
object of a specified class. The caller would declare the desired
type inline:

```bash
into=o _AS=List boop.classPath list
$o.length    # → number of entries
$o.each ...  # iterate as a List
```

This would let any method that returns a multi-value string
(newline-delimited, etc.) hand back a typed object instead of a
raw string — without the callee knowing or caring about the
wrapping.

Open questions:
- Does `boop.pass` handle the wrapping, or does the caller's
  `into=` assignment trigger it?
- Performance cost of creating an object on every return?
- What if the class isn't loaded yet — auto-import?
- Is this just sugar for `into=raw method; into=o List "$raw"`?

Might not be worth the complexity. Investigate and decide.

## Try/Catch Mechanism -- Low Priority

Bash has no native try/catch. Every approach has serious tradeoffs:

- **Subshell**: clean isolation, but loses all side effects (variable
  mutations, registry changes, object creation). Dealbreaker for a
  framework built on global state.
- **eval + trap ERR**: side effects survive, but the try block is
  either a string (eval, gross) or a function name. `_Crash` would
  need to know it's inside a try context and `return` instead of
  `exit`. Unwinding the call stack requires either `set -e` behavior
  or every function checking a try-depth flag. Fragile.
- **Signal-based**: `_Crash` sends USR1, try wrapper traps it. But
  bash signal delivery is unpredictable -- only between commands,
  not mid-builtin.

Conclusion: the cure is worse than the disease. Developers should
handle errors explicitly with exit codes and `_Crash`. The fatality
threshold (`_FatalLevel`) already provides escalation control.

Revisit if a compelling use case emerges that can't be solved with
explicit error handling.

## README Accuracy Audit

Specific points to address in the next README edit pass:

1. **"objects with encapsulated state"** -- state is convention-private
   (`__` prefix), not mechanism-private. No access control. Suggest
   "objects with managed state" or "objects with structured state."

2. **"The default fatality threshold is `error`"** -- WRONG. Default is
   `crash` (only explicit `_Crash` is fatal). Fix to match actual behavior.

3. **"1,400+ assertions"** -- needs verification. Actual count is likely
   lower (~800-900 across all suites). Count properly and update.

4. **"~2,200 lines of bash"** -- actual is ~2,500. Update.

5. **"production-quality implementations"** -- JSON doesn't handle unicode
   escapes, Math has untested methods. Soften to "well-tested" or
   "substantial."

6. **`_Super.greet` in subclassing example** -- WRONG. Actual syntax is
   `_Super greet` (space, not dot). `_Super` is a function that takes
   the method name as `$1`. Fix the example.

7. **Helper documentation** -- `_Super`, `_Cast`, `_Delegate`, `_Bless`
   need careful documentation with correct syntax and examples. These
   are easy to get wrong and the README is the first place people look.

8. **"No subshells in the hot path"** -- accurate for dispatch and
   property access. JSON stringify uses `sort -n` (subshell) for array
   key ordering. Note this or fix it.

9. **"Properties are typed as strings"** -- meaningless in bash where
   everything is a string. The sentence adds nothing and confuses
   readers from typed languages who might think there's a type system.
   Either remove it or replace with something useful like "All values
   are stored as strings in the descriptor. Numeric operations require
   explicit arithmetic context." Needs a reference to the descriptor
   storage docs in docs/boop.md.

10. **General: every non-obvious claim needs a reference** -- statements
    about behavior, limitations, or design choices should link to the
    relevant section in docs/ where the full explanation lives. If no
    such section exists, that's a flag to write one. The README is a
    tour guide, not the encyclopedia.

11. **`local -I` usage is inconsistent** -- README explains and uses
    `local -I _Self _Class` in the class authoring example. But actual
    class files (Box, List, etc.) use `local _Self="${_Self:-...}"
    _Class="${_Class:-...}"` instead. Framework internals (isa, get,
    set) use `local -I _Self` but NOT `local -I _Class`. The README
    needs to document the CURRENT convention, explain why it changed
    (if it did), and the example must match what real classes do.
    Also: if `local -I` was removed for a reason, that reason should
    be documented in STANDARDS.md or docs/boop.md.
